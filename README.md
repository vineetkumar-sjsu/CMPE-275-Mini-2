# CMPE 275 Mini-Project 2: Fire Query System

**Course:** CMPE 275 - Enterprise Application Development
**Project:** Multi-Process Distributed Query System with gRPC and Shared Memory

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **distributed query processing system** for California wildfire air quality data using a multi-process architecture. The system demonstrates advanced concepts in distributed systems including:

- **Multi-process coordination** with hierarchical delegation
- **gRPC-based inter-process communication** with server-side streaming
- **Cross-language integration** (C++ and Python)
- **POSIX shared memory** for status coordination
- **Data partitioning** across distributed processes
- **Chunked streaming** for efficient memory management

### System Architecture

The system consists of **6 processes** organized in a 3-tier hierarchical structure:

```
Client (fire_client)
      ↓
Process A (Leader)                    Port 50051
      ├→ Process B (Team Green Leader) → Port 50052
      │     └→ Process C (Worker)       → Port 50053
      │
      └→ Process E (Team Pink Leader)  → Port 50055
            ├→ Process D (Team Leader)  → Port 50054
            └→ Process F (Python Worker) → Port 50056
```

**Key Features:**
- **Process A**: Central leader that receives client queries and delegates to team leaders
- **Processes B & E**: Team leaders that coordinate workers and process their data partitions
- **Processes C, D, F**: Worker processes that handle specific date ranges of data
- **Process F**: Implemented in Python to demonstrate cross-language interoperability
- **Chunked Streaming**: Results streamed in chunks of 500 records for memory efficiency
- **Shared Memory**: Used only for status coordination (not for query results)

### Dataset

The system processes California wildfire air quality sensor data from **August 10 to September 24, 2020** (43 days), partitioned across processes:
- **Process B**: 10 dates (Aug 10-22)
- **Process C**: 10 dates (Aug 23 - Sep 1)
- **Process D**: 6 dates (Sep 2-7)
- **Process E**: 6 dates (Sep 8-13)
- **Process F**: 11 dates (Sep 14-24)

   ```bash
   # Check if already installed
   g++ --version
   # or
   clang++ --version
   ```

---

## Installation and Build Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vineetkumar-sjsu/CMPE-275-Mini-2.git
cd CMPE-275-Mini-2
```

### Step 2: Configure Data Path

The system needs to know where to find the fire data. You have **three options**:

**Option A: Use Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
# Option A1: Let start_all.sh set it automatically (easiest!)
# Just run ./start_all.sh - it will auto-detect the fire-data directory

# Option A2: Set it manually in your shell
export FIRE_DATA_PATH=$(pwd)/fire-data

# Option A3: Create a .env file (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set FIRE_DATA_PATH, then source it:
source .env
```

The `start_all.sh` script will automatically set `FIRE_DATA_PATH` if not already defined, so **no action needed** if using the start script!

**Option B: Update Configuration Files**
```bash
# Update all 6 config files with your absolute path
sed -i '' "s|/absolute/path/to/fire-data|$(pwd)/fire-data|g" configs/*.json
```

**Option C: Manual Edit**
Edit `configs/process_a.json` through `configs/process_f.json` and update the `"data_path"` field.

**Note:** The fire-data directory contains 43 days of California wildfire air quality data (Aug 10 - Sep 24, 2020) with 516 CSV files (~180MB total). The system checks for `FIRE_DATA_PATH` environment variable first, then falls back to the config file path.

### Step 3: Generate Protocol Buffer Code

```bash
chmod +x generate_proto.sh
./generate_proto.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Generating C++ protobuf code...
Generating Python protobuf code...
Protobuf generation complete!
```

### Step 4: Build C++ Components

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
cd ..
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[100%] Built target fire_query_proto
[100%] Built target leader_server
[100%] Built target team_leader_server
[100%] Built target worker_server
[100%] Built target fire_client
```

**Verify executables were created:**
```bash
ls -la build/
# You should see: leader_server, team_leader_server, worker_server, fire_client
```

### Step 5: Create Log Directory

```bash
mkdir -p logs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection refused" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if processes are running
ps aux | grep server

# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :50051-50056

# Restart the system
./stop_all.sh
./start_all.sh
```

### Issue: "Failed to attach to shared memory"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure Process A (leader) starts first
./stop_all.sh
# Wait 2 seconds, then
./start_all.sh
```

### Issue: Build fails with "Protobuf not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# For Anaconda users, specify paths explicitly:
cmake .. -DProtobuf_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/anaconda3/include \
         -DProtobuf_LIBRARIES=/opt/anaconda3/lib/libprotobuf.dylib
make -j4
```

### Issue: Python import errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure protobuf Python files are generated
./generate_proto.sh

# Install Python dependencies
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools protobuf
```

### Issue: No data returned from queries

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify fire data directory exists
ls -la fire-data/

# Check process logs for errors
cat logs/process_*.log
```

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Hierarchical Delegation
Process A delegates queries to team leaders B and E, which further delegate to their workers (C and F). This creates a tree structure that scales efficiently.

### 2. Data Partitioning
The 43 days of fire data are partitioned across 5 processes (B, C, D, E, F) with no overlaps. Each process loads only its assigned dates, enabling parallel query processing.

### 3. Chunked Streaming
Results are streamed in fixed-size chunks (500 records) instead of loading all data into memory. This enables:
- Low memory footprint
- Early processing on client side
- Better responsiveness for large queries

### 4. Cross-Language Integration
Process F is implemented in Python while all others are C++. This demonstrates gRPC's language-agnostic design - both implementations use the same `.proto` definition and communicate seamlessly.

### 5. Configuration-Driven Architecture
All process IDs, ports, hosts, and data partitions are defined in JSON configuration files. This enables:
- Easy multi-host deployment (just update IPs in JSON)
- No code recompilation for configuration changes
- Clear separation of code and configuration

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
Each process logs its operations to individual log files, making debugging and monitoring straightforward. All gRPC errors are properly handled with status codes.

## Testing Evidence

The system has been thoroughly tested with the following scenarios:

1. **Single-process query** (dates 20200810-20200815): Only Process B contributes
2. **Multi-process query** (dates 20200810-20200924): All 4 data processes contribute
3. **Python integration**: Process F successfully returns 5,000 records
4. **Chunked streaming**: 41 chunks with 500 records each verified
5. **Error handling**: Invalid dates, connection failures handled gracefully

Log files in `logs/` directory provide complete execution traces.

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production deployment:

1. **Fault Tolerance**: Worker failover and retry logic
2. **Query Optimization**: Predicate pushdown, query caching
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time process health visualization
4. **Authentication**: Secure gRPC with SSL/TLS certificates
5. **Container Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes support
6. **Load Balancing**: Dynamic work distribution based on process load
